## Prerequisites

Create the conda environment:

``` 
    conda env create -f environment.yml
```



### Follow these steps:


1) Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) and get the Dataset.

2) Save it within you directory in the input folder as describet in the structure above.

3) Just Run the Notebook.


## Workflow

When you click the button *Create Scheduler for next week*, an entry in the *Data/scheduler_df.csv* will be created for the upcoming week.
For that reason you cannot create multiple events for the upcoming week. If you wanna re-do the event adding, just go into the *scheduler_df.csv* 
and set the True to False.


## Run the Notebook

```
    cd/you_cloned_repo_location/Notebooks jupyter notebook
```

## Deployment

Just pull the repo, if you wanna change sth you can ask :)
